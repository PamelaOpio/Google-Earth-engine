#This code assumes that you have a raster file called "landslide_raster.tif" that contains predictor variables 
#for the model, and that you have already loaded the randomForest, raster, and rgdal libraries into R. 
#The code converts the raster data to a data frame, adds a column for the landslide variable, and then 
# trains a random forest model on the training data. It then makes predictions on the test data, calculates 
# the model's accuracy, and saves the model to a file.
#To use this model within QGIS, you can use the predict() function to make predictions on new raster data, 
#and then use the raster() function to convert the predictions back to a raster format. You can also use 
# the plot() function to visualize the predictions on a map.#

#First merge all the predictor and input layers into one.The Merge tool can only be used to merge raster files 
# that have the same projection, resolution, and number of bands. If the input raster files do not meet these 
#requirements, you may need to reproject or resample one or both of the rasters before merging them.
#To change the pixels of a raster, double click >Export as > Name > Input new resolution (30,30)

# Load required libraries

# Convert the raster data to a data frame

# Add a column for the landslide variable
df$landslide <- factor(df$layer)

# Split the data into training and test sets
set.seed(123)
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df$landslide, p = 0.7, list = FALSE, times = 1)
train <- df[splitIndex, ]
test <- df[-splitIndex, ]

model <- randomForest(landslide ~ ., data = train)

# Make predictions on the test set

# Calculate the model's accuracy
accuracy <- mean(predictions == test$landslide)
print(accuracy)
